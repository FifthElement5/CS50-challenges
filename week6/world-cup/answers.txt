Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Small number of simulation dont give predictions for all 16-teams

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Prediction after 100000 simulations seems "good enought" during my testing
